# multiScaleR Workshop: Multiscale Ecological Modeling in R

**Bill Peterman & Joseph Drake**

A half-day hands-on tutorial for identifying species-specific scales of effect using camera trap data and the [`multiScaleR`](https://github.com/wpeterman/multiScaleR) R package. The workshop uses real data from Moll et al. (2019, *Ecography*), covering 207 camera trap sites across the Cleveland Metroparks urban park system and three focal mammal species that illustrate contrasting patterns of habitat response.

## Workshop Overview

| Section | Topic | Time |
|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | Setup and prerequisites | 15 min |
| 2 | What is a scale of effect? | 20 min |
| 3 | Data loading and exploration | 25 min |
| 4 | Domestic cat: the full workflow | 40 min |
| 5 | Eastern chipmunk: a boundary case | 25 min |
| — | Break | 15 min |
| 6 | White-tailed deer: landscape-scale response | 30 min |
| 7 | Beyond the PCA: development and forest cover | 35 min |
| 8 | Spatial prediction | 25 min |
| 9 | Summary and next steps | 10 min |

### Focal Species

- **Domestic cat** — small-scale positive response to urbanization
- **Eastern chipmunk** — a boundary case that teaches diagnostic interpretation
- **White-tailed deer** — broad landscape-scale positive response to urbanization

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to prepare spatial data for scale-of-effect analysis, optimize kernel scale parameters with `multiScaleR`, interpret results and diagnostic profiles (including boundary cases), extend analyses to individual NLCD land cover types, and project predictions across a landscape.

## Rendered HTML Files

Two pre-rendered HTML files are provided so you can follow along or review results without running any R code:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Full_Eval__multiScaleR_workshop.html` | All code chunks evaluated — shows full outputs, figures, and model results |
| `TextCode_Only__multiScaleR_workshop.html` | Code is displayed but not evaluated — useful as a clean reference while working interactively |

Open either file in any web browser. No R installation is required to view them.

## Getting the Data

The data and precomputed model files are distributed as release assets rather than in the repository ZIP, because GitHub does not serve large files correctly from the ZIP download.

1. Download the code: use the green **Code > Download ZIP** button on the repository page, then unzip.
2. Download the data from the [v1.0 release](https://github.com/wpeterman/multiScaleR_Workshop/releases/tag/v1.0):
   - **`workshop_data.zip`** (required, ~13 MB) — camera locations, detection counts, and raster covariates
   - **`workshop_precomputed.zip`** (optional but recommended, ~506 MB) — pre-optimized model results for each species
3. Unzip both files into the repository folder so that `data/` and `precomputed/` sit alongside `multiScaleR_workshop.qmd`.

## Working Through the Tutorial Interactively

The tutorial is designed to be run chunk-by-chunk in RStudio using `multiScaleR_workshop.qmd`.

### Setup

1. Install required packages if you have not already:

```r
install.packages(c("terra", "sf", "readxl", "MASS", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
remotes::install_github("wpeterman/multiScaleR")
```

`multiScaleR` >= 0.6.11 is required. **Minimum 8 GB RAM is recommended;** the deer analysis (Section 6) uses approximately 1.5 GB.

2. Open `workshop.Rproj` in RStudio. This sets the working directory correctly so all relative file paths resolve without modification.

3. Open `multiScaleR_workshop.qmd`. The `DATA_DIR` and `PRECOMP_DIR` variables at the top of the setup chunk point to `data/` and `precomputed/` respectively; update these only if you move files.

### Running Code

- Execute individual chunks with the green **Run** button or `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).
- Work through sections **in order**; later sections depend on objects created earlier.
- The tutorial document has `eval: false` set globally, so rendering the `.qmd` file will not re-run the analysis. Run chunks interactively instead.

### Pre-computed Results

Scale optimization can take several minutes. Each section that runs an optimization includes a **Pre-computed Fallback** block:

```r
opt_cat_pca <- readRDS(file.path(PRECOMP_DIR, "opt_cat_pca.rds"))
```

Load the pre-computed result and continue if you want to skip the optimization step or if it runs longer than expected.
